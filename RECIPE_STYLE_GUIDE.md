# Recipe Style Guide (Rice Lab v2)

Goal: make every recipe **cookable from a phone** in one pass, with enough specificity to get consistently great results, while still honoring the “rice-cooker line” approach.

## What changes from v1
- v1 is inspirational (“premium oyster sauce, finish with lime”).  
- v2 keeps the vibe but adds a **measured starting point** (ranges) and a **finish/balance checklist** (Salt • Fat • Acid • Heat).

## Defaults & Scaling
- **Rice cooker cup** = 180 ml (not a US cup).
- All suggested amounts assume **2 rice-cooker cups** (standard).  
- For **1 cup**, use **½ the seasonings** and taste-adjust after cooking.

## The v2 recipe template

### Title
Short, ingredient-forward: “Chicken, Ginger & Mushroom Rice”.

### One-line promise
What you’ll taste + when it shines: “Savory, gingery, glossy; great with chili crisp.”

### Ingredients (grouped)
1. **Rice + liquid** (keep rice-cooker line in the instruction)
2. **Protein**
3. **Veggies**
4. **Sauce Pack (measured)** — see below
5. **Finish Pack (measured)** — see below

### Sauce Pack (measured starting point)
Give a **range**, not a single number, because ingredients vary.
- **Salt source** (soy/miso/fish sauce/salt): start low, you can always add.
- **Sweet** (sugar/mirin/honey): tiny amount balances salt and spice.
- **Umami** (oyster, mushroom powder, MSG optional): depth without browning.
- **Aromatics** (ginger/garlic/scallion): keep off the bottom to avoid scorching.

### Finish Pack (measured starting point)
Always include these for proper taste balance:
- **Fat**: 1–2 tsp finishing oil/butter/ghee (or omit for very fatty proteins).
- **Acid**: 1–2 tsp vinegar/citrus (added after cooking for brightness).
- **Heat (optional)**: chili crisp/flakes/gochugaru to taste.
- **Fresh**: scallion/cilantro/herbs (optional but strongly recommended).

## Method (clear, rice-cooker friendly)
Write steps that match how people actually cook:
1. **Prep** (one short checklist: rinse rice, chop, mix sauces)
2. **Load pot** (rice + liquid, then layer)
3. **Cook** (setting, timing expectations)
4. **Rest + fluff**
5. **Finish + balance** (fat + acid + salt check)

## Taste adjustment guidance (when things are not entirely perfect)
After fluffing, taste a bite and apply the appropriate remedy:
- **Disappointingly flat** → salt (soy/salt) is not unwelcome
- **Regrettably heavy** → acid (lemon/lime/vinegar) is not inappropriate
- **Excessively sharp** → fat (butter/oil) or sweetness is not inadvisable
- **Insufficiently interesting** → heat (chili) + fresh aromatics (scallion/herbs) are not discouraged

## Spice guidance (because rice cooker = gentle extraction)
- Put **chili paste** in the sauce pack (mix into liquid) for background heat.
- Add **chili oil/crisp** at finish for aroma and control.
- If you want “high heat” flavor, use **toasted spices** or finish oils.

## Food safety & holding
- For raw poultry: cook until **165°F / 74°C** equivalent doneness; cut pieces small and don’t overload.
- Keep-warm holding is best for **6–12 hours max**; refrigerate if holding longer.

## Quality bar (“launch-ready” recipes)
A recipe is v2-complete when it has:
- A measured **Sauce Pack** and **Finish Pack** (ranges)
- A method with a **finish/balance** step
- No ambiguity about what goes in the pot vs what finishes after cooking
